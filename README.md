## Description

This script will help you collect video metrics from all the videos in your channel. You'll need a Youtube API key that you can sign up for from the developers.google.com site. More resources to help you are here:

After API integration , We are gonna a create a AWS RDS instance and store our result there. We will also create methods for updating values and creating new records for future work on data. And finally I am using pgAdmin to view the Table stored in AWS RDS instance.
